## Development

Initialize and update submodules:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

### Git Submodules

The `git submodule update` command fetches the commit specified in `.git/modules` for each submodule of the parent Git repository. In order to update a submodule to the latest commit available from its remote reference, you will need to pull it directly:

```bash
cd <path/to/submodule>
git pull origin master
cd <path/to/parent>
git add . && git commit -m "Update submodules"
```

### Hugo

**UPDATE**: As of version v0.60.0, this issue has been resolved:

>[Goldmark](https://github.com/yuin/goldmark) by [@yuin](https://github.com/yuin) is now the new default library used for Markdown in Hugo. It’s CommonMark compliant and GitHub flavored, and both fast and flexible. Blackfriday, the old default, has served us well, but there have been formatting and portability issues that were hard to work around. The “CommonMark compliant” part is the main selling feature of Goldmark, but with that you also get attribute syntax on headers and code blocks (for code blocks you can turn on/off line numbers and highlight line ranges), strikethrough support and an improved and configurable implementation of `TableOfContents`. See [Markup Configuration](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration-markup) for an overview of extensions.

Currently, this repository is pinned to Hugo v0.55.4 due to a rendering [issue](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/6040) of lists with code blocks introduced in Hugo v0.55.5.

To install Hugo v0.55.4 via `go get`:

```bash
# remove symlinks for Hugo formula
brew unlink hugo

# install Hugo via `go get`
go get -v github.com/gohugoio/hugo

# checkout version v0.55.4
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/gohugoio/hugo
git checkout v0.55.4
go install

# confirm version
hugo version
```
