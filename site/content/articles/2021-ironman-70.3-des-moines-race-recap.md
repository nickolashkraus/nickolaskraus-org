## Race Recap

Overall, my performance at IRONMAN 70.3 Des Moines was OK.

### Swim

The swim turned out to be my most challenging event. I can consistently swim at 1:50 min./100 yd. for long durations, however my training leading up to the race was always indoors and almost always with buoyancy shorts. These factors turned out to be a serious crutch, which was revealed in a big way on Sunday.

I exited the swim exhausted and far behind my goal. Worse still, the strain I put into the swim elevated my heart rate severely, which I would spend the remainder of the race trying to keep under control.

### Bike

The bike portion, my strongest event, was hampered by the fact that I knew I would have to soft-pedal the course in order to have a chance at finishing the run.

### Run

During the run, I started cramping in my quads and hamstrings, which I attribute to a poor nutritional strategy and overexertion in the swim. I spent most of the run at a slower pace because of it.

## Retrospective

During training, I fell into the typical age-grouper trap of training too long at moderate intensity instead of following a prescribed 80/20 program with proper periodization. To address this, I've been reading the following two books:
* The Triathlete's Training Bible by Joe Friel
* 80/20 Triathlon by Matt Fitzgerald and David Warden

Additionally, my nutrition just wasn't scientific. I used a mix I typically use for strength training, which did not serve me in this event.

Overall, I learned a lot, realized a shit ton of mistakes both in training and in racing, and am taking steps to improve them. I'm coming back for the race in 2022. By then I am hoping to be a stronger and smarter athlete. But first, I need to course correct for 2021 IRONMAN 70.3 Arizona.
