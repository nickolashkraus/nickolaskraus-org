I like my local development setup to be lean and automated. This allows me to get up and running with a new machine in under an hour. The following is a comprehensive walk through of the tools and productivity modifications that I use.

This walk through references several configuration files. These configuration files (typically referred to as *dotfiles*) can be found [here](https://github.com/nickolashkraus/dotfiles)

## macOS

### Rebind Caps Lock to Control
To rebind Caps Lock (⇪) to Control (⌃) go to **System Preferences** > **Keyboard** > **Modifier Keys…** and change **Caps Lock (⇪) Key:** to **^ Control**.

### Configure shortcuts
To configure macOS shortcuts, go to **System Preferences** > **Keyboard** > **Shortcuts**.

For macOS, my shortcuts are as follows:

| | |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| Show Spotlight search | `^Space`  |

To configure application shortcuts, go to **App Shortcuts** > **+** and enter the **Menu Title** as given in the application and the desired keyboard shortcut.

For Chrome, my shortcuts are as follows:

| Menu Title          |  Shortcut   |
|---------------------|-------------|
| New Tab             |  `^T`       |
| Select Next Tab     |  `^K`       |
| Select Previous Tab |  `^J`       |
| Close Tab           |  `^W`       |
| Find...             |  `^F`       |
| Find Next           |  `^G`       |
| Find Previous       |  `^B`       |
| New Window          |  `^N`       |
| Close Window        |  `^Q`       |
| Open Location...    |  `^L`       |
| Reload This Page    |  `^R`       |

### Remove dock auto-hide delay
On the off chance that I use the dock, this ensures that it appears without a delay:

```bash
defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -int 0
defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -int 0
```

### Enable Key Repeat
To enable key repeat, use the following command:

```bash
defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
```

To modify key repeat speed, go to **System Preferences** > **Keyboard** > and increase or decrease *Key Repeat* and *Delay Until Repeat*.

## Git
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version-control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.

### Installation
The easiest way to install Git on macOS is to install the Xcode Command Line Tools:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

### Configuration
* [.gitconfig](https://github.com/nickolashkraus/dotfiles/blob/master/.gitconfig)

```bash
ln -s ~/path/to/remote/.gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
```

## iTerm2
[iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) is a replacement for the standard macOS terminal.

### Installation

```bash
curl -LOk https://iterm2.com/downloads/stable/iTerm2-3_2_7.zip
unzip -q iTerm2-3_2_7.zip
mv iTerm.app /Applications
rm iTerm2-3_2_7.zip
```

### Configuration
* [com.googlecode.iterm2.plist](https://github.com/nickolashkraus/dotfiles/blob/master/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist)
* [colorscheme.itermcolors](https://github.com/nickolashkraus/dotfiles/blob/master/colorscheme.itermcolors)

To set the [plist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_list), go to **Preferences** > **General**. Under **Preferences**, set *Load preferences from a custom folder of URL* to the location of `com.googlecode.iterm2.plist`.

To set the color scheme, go to **Preferences** > **Profiles** > **Colors** > **Color Presets...** > **Import...** and import `colorscheme.itermcolors`. *colorscheme* will then appear under **Color Presets...**.
